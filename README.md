## This fork

- Contains some bug fixes and enhancements.

## Instructions

The app allows the user to enter data but as well comes with some English-German words preloaded. This is defined in the file ``memorystore.js``. If you want to preload the app with your own words you have to create a file ``memorystore.js``.
